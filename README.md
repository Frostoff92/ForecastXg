# FORECATS GOALS WITH xG

## My experimental application in the form of a table for the estimated score in a football match.

The data is based on the following parameters:

* *Scores by home team*;
* *Missed by home team*;
* *Created scoring chances by the home team*;
* *Lost scoring chances by the home team*;
* *Scores with guests*;
* *Missed by guests*;
* *Created scoring chances by guests*;
* *Missed scoring chances by guests*;

On the basis of simple formulas, the average value is calculated how much home/away team can scored.
