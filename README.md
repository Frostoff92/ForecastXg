My experimental application in the form of a table for the estimated score in a football match.

The data is based on the following parameters:

Scores by hosts;
Missed by hosts;
Created scoring chances by the hosts;
Lost scoring chances by the hosts;
Scores with guests;
Missed by guests;
Created scoring chances by guests;
Missed scoring chances by guests;

On the basis of simple formulas, the average value is calculated how much home/away team can scored.
